# Springboard Foundations of Data Science: Capstone Project Ideas
##### Greg Cloonan

### 1. Saving the Sweetbriars: *Developing an assessment of financial health and risk for universities*

##### Overview:
Over the past several years, headlines have featured small and medium-sized colleges permanently shuttering their gates to the dismay of employees, students, and alumni.

Using Dept. of Education surveys, I will develop an assessment based on several KPI's to understand and quantify a given school's underlying financial health and trajectory.

### 2. I ain't got no type, curve: *Predicting oil well production by developing local type curves*

##### Overview:
Accurately predicting oil well production is financially prudent yet elusive for many oil companies, especially with the advent of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing.

I will attempt to determine the method for constructing a type curve (fluids production projections over time based on flow equations) using available covariates (in addition to location) that most accurately predicts crude production at the well-level for a validation data set.

##### Data Source:
Most states require operators to report monthly production data. TBD based on project selection and data availability by state.



### 3. Let them eat light: *Exploring the penetration of rooftop solar in middle and lower class communities*

##### Overview:
We're fed a narrative of the explosion in popularity of rooftop solar, but I want to explore how accurate this is beyond the upper echelons of society.

California has adopted liberal policies that incentivize adoption and is seen as a global leader in alternative energy sources, making it an ideal location to explore solar adoption in relation to economic class.

I expect some differences simply due to ability to pay but would like to understand the extent to which solar has expanded beyond the rooftops of the Silicon Valley elite.

### 4. Show me the money: *Predicting athlete performance when changing teams*

##### Overview:
NFL teams pay exorbitant amounts (often much of it in guaranteed sums) for players based soley on historical performance in a dramatically different environment (teammates, coaches, climate, etc.).

As a result, players frequently end up large disappointments or steals when traded. I will attempt to reduce this element of surprise.

I plan to analyze individual performance with data on team environments to more accurately project performance when the environment (team) changes.

This could be invaluable in more accurately pricing player contracts.
